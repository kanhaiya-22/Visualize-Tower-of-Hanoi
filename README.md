# Tower of Hanoi - Interactive Puzzle Game 🎮

## Overview 🌟

This project implements the classic **Tower of Hanoi** puzzle game using **JavaScript** and **SVG** (Scalable Vector Graphics). It includes an interactive interface with visual representations of disks and pegs, along with step-by-step controls, animations, and an optimized solution using dynamic programming.

### Key Features ✨
- **Interactive User Interface**: Play the Tower of Hanoi game with a graphical SVG-based interface. 🖼️
- **Step-by-Step Mode**: Allows users to control the game flow step-by-step. ⏩
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimized solution using dynamic programming for minimal moves. 🔢
- **Disk Movement Animations**: Smooth animations for moving disks between pegs. 🎞️
- **Abort/Resume**: Allows pausing, resuming, and aborting animations at any time. ⏸️ ▶️ ❌

## Technologies Used 💻

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For game logic, animations, and handling user interactions. 🔮
- **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: For rendering the game's visual elements (disks, pegs, and base). 🖌️
- **HTML5**: For structuring the game UI and appending the SVG elements. 🌐
- **CSS**: For basic styling, like rounding corners and adding drop shadows. 🎨
- **Async/Await**: For handling asynchronous disk movements and animations. ⏳
- **AbortController**: To abort ongoing animations and allow user control over the game's flow. 🚫
- **Dynamic Programming**: To calculate the optimal sequence of moves efficiently. 📊

## How It Works 🔧

### 1. **Game Setup** ⚙️
   - The game is initialized with a configurable number of pegs and disks. 🧩
   - Each disk is visually represented by a rectangle, and pegs are placed vertically. 🟦
   - The base of the puzzle is rendered at the bottom. 🟩

### 2. **Game Logic** 🎮
   - The goal is to move all the disks from the first peg to the last peg, following the rules:
     - Only one disk can be moved at a time. 🔄
     - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk. 🚫
   - The solution is calculated using dynamic programming to minimize the number of moves. 🔢

### 3. **Disk Movement** 🎞️
   - Each disk's movement is animated with SVG's `<animateMotion>` tag. 🏃‍♂️
   - The disk moves smoothly along a path calculated based on the starting and target peg positions. ➡️

### 4. **Step-by-Step Mode** ⏩
   - In step mode, users can manually progress the game one move at a time, providing more control over the puzzle-solving process. 📅
   - Users can pause, resume, or abort the game at any time. ⏸️ ▶️ ❌
